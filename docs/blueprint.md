## Core Features:

- ID Verification: Capture ID/passport scan (OCR) and selfie with liveness check, using a tool like Onfido or Veriff to perform ID scan, OCR, face match, and liveness.
- Contract Generation and E-Signature: Auto-populate guest info into a dynamic contract template, allow guests to read and e-sign the contract within the app, and store the signed PDF.
- Check-in Instructions: Upon successful verification and contract signing, unlock property-specific check-in instructions, door codes, Wi-Fi details, and maps.
- Property Onboarding (Host): Allow hosts to add/edit properties with a unique ID, name, type, address, images, rules, and check-in/out templates.
- Reservation Management (Host): Provide a reservation list with verification status, and manual verification override options.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) for a sense of security and sophistication, fitting for identity verification.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5), almost white, providing a clean and modern backdrop that makes key interface elements pop.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) as an accent color to highlight important actions, such as completing identity verification or signing the contract, complementing the deep purple and adding a touch of vibrancy.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text. Its modern, neutral look will lend the interface an objective, machined feel.
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent different verification steps and property details. Icons should be consistent in style and weight.
- Maintain a clean, intuitive layout with clear hierarchy. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter. On mobile, use a vertical layout for the checkin flow to optimize ease-of-use.
- Use subtle animations to guide users through the check-in and verification process, such as progress indicators and confirmation animations.
